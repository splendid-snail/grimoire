<p>The lorde of this realm, Napmarel, is an Emperor of seeming good cheer, but mistake him not, he is a fearesome being. Be wary of attracting his attention, else, you shall Die.

Lelmar commands a host of 101 spirits & demons, whom he may place at thy command. You shall hear him speak in a mad voice. He has shewn himself as a Hippopotamus and in the spirit realm as a Giant. He may appeare to you as an interesting fletcher.  He can teacheth the art of astronomy, Arithmitic, geomitry and all other handicrafts absolutely. Lelmar's Planetary influence is under Mars. In order to conjure and evoke the Archduke Lelmar, you must make sure you have with you an old cloak, for it shall be required in the summoning. <p>His sigil is thus to be made and used as directed:</p>

</p>
<p><p>Before attempting to summon the Archduke Lelmar, you will need to Bathe thyself thoroughly and light fragrant incense. You will also need to prepare the old cloak.</p>
<p>Before Lelmar will Shew himself to you, you must peform the following sacrifice.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will first need to get thyself a goat, for it is this that you shall sacrifice.</li>
<li>You will need to carry out this rite in A cellar.</li>
<li>Next, in this place you must prepare steel altar and place the old cloak upon it. You may feel fear while you do so, but to appease Lelmar you must do it whilst seeming to show good cheer.</li>
<li>Next set the goat upon the altar, restrained as necessary, then brace thyself and take up a knife.</li>
<li>Before you commit the final deed, focus thy mind upon the word of power: Chaxalothan.</li>
<li>Next is to kill the goat with thy knife. When the deed is done, spread its blood about the floor in the pattern of great Lelmar's sigil. thou art ready to consult the great Archduke Lelmar.</li>
