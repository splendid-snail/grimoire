<h3 id="Gerciel">Of this realm's 13th Demon, Gerciel</h3>
<p><strong>The 13th demon in the Lower realm is called Gerciel.</strong> He is a humble Seigneur of the REALM and capable of lesser cantrips. As a Seigneur, Gerciel commands 5 spirits which may do your bidding. His voice is strange and melodic. You may see him firste as a lion, and his demonic form is like to that of a sylph. He may also come to you as a direct fletcher to drive a bargain.  His office is to maketh men witty and bold. Gerciel's Planetary influence is under Uranus. Before attempting to summon the Seigneur Gerciel you will need to find a bloody clothe and keep it about you. <p>His sigil appeareth thus:</p>

<div class="w3-quarter w3-container"> <p></p> </div><div class="w3-half w3-container"><img src="sigils/sigil__78.png"class="w3-image"></div>
</div>
</p>
<p><p>Before attempting to summon the Seigneur Gerciel, you will need to find a Cat and pull its Tail and meditate for a day. You will also need to prepare the bloody cloth.</p>
<p>Gerciel is a being of Chaos, and will be most pleased with you if you shew a Dance for him.</p>
<ol><li>The first step is to attract the demon's attention. To do so, you must gesture with your Right leg. Make sure also that you have the bloody cloth close at hand.</li>
<li>When this is done, the next thing is to gyrate thy head while you  wiggle thy left fiste.</li>
<li>Keep doing this until you reach a frenzy, keeping the bloody cloth held close about you at all times, and finally Shake Your hands while you chant "Darjothmor, Darjothmor".</li>
<li>As you feel the dark Power rise within you, use the bloody cloth to trace the seale of Gerciel in the Aire, chanting "Darjothmor" as you do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now at this Climax of the ritual, to invoke the Seigneur Gerciel intone the following:</p>
