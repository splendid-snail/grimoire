<hr><h2>The King and Spirits of the North realm</h2>
<p>Know that this realm is Dominat`d by the powerful Lord Horrmormor. In this realm`s Pleroma are the spirits of earthe and snowe, where the influences of cold things are most strong.</p>
<h3>Of this realm's King</h3>
<p>The lorde of this realm, Horrmormor, is a Lord whose name fills men and beasts alike with fear, and the sound of this name, pronounced properly, is akin to a dire scream. If you raise his wrath your most beloved friend shall be turned into a parrot, which you shall be made to watch, and then you shall both die. To observe the affairs of demons and men undetected, he may go about as a chinchilla or a reindeer, this latter of an unnatural colour.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Sayazan">Of this realm's 1st Demon, Sayazan</h3>
<p><strong>The 1st demon in the North realm is called Sayazan.</strong> He is a Count and a middling leader in this realm. The Count Sayazan commands a moderate force of 27 spirits who he may show you. His voice soundeth beguiling when you call on him. You may see him firste as a leopard and in the spirit realm as a nymphe. He goes about unknown among men as a Stupid cook.  When charmed he is of a good nature, & will reconcileth friends. Under the influence of Celestial bodies, you may find him easier to contact when Mercury is in Ascendency. Necessary for the summoning or evocation of Sayazan the Count shall be an old cloak, which shall please Sayazan greatly. He is a notorious liar even by the standards of Hell. Do not trust him.<p>His sigil is thus to be made and used as directed:</p>
<div class="w3-row-padding">

</div>
</p>
<p><p>Before summoning Count Sayazan, Bathe thyself thoroughly and bathe thyself thoroughlye and obtain a useful Old cloak.</p>
<p>Sayazan is a being of Chaos, and will be most pleased with you if you shew a Dance for him.</p>
<ol><li>The first step is to gesture with your finger of your right hand, which shall attract the Demon's attention. Make sure also that you have the old cloak close at hand.</li>
<li>When this is done, the next thing is to push out Your handeth while you  push oute Your right hand.</li>
<li>Keep doing this until you reach a frenzy, keeping the old cloak held close about you at all times, & finally wave Your fists while you chant "Sawanalal, Sawanalal".</li>
<li>At last, keeping up the Chant use the old cloak to trace mighty Sayazan's Sigil in the aire before you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now at this Climax of the ritual, to invoke the Count Sayazan intone the following:</p>

<p><strong>The 2nd demon in the North realm is called Hefel.</strong> He is a mere and lowly Baronet of this realm, barely noticed by his king Horrmormor and thereby more able to serve you. As a humble Baronet in the forces of his Lord Horrmormor, Hefel commands a smalle company of 3 spirits. His voice is strange and reedy. You may see him firste as an Opossum and in the spirit realm as a Wraithe. He goes about unknown among men as a fussy mayor.  He may destroy Dignities. Hefel's Planetary influence is under Earth.

<li>With the room prepared, take a r`d chalk or Pencile and enscribe a circle of 7 feet upon the floor. You must do this with your left hand, or you will lose your Hair. Finally Chalke his seale throughout the diameter of the circle.</li>
<li>Next, take the Lyre which you have prepared & place it carefully at the north point, taking utmost care as you do so.</li>
<li>All this done, around the perimeter of the Circle, write the following words respectively at the points North, South, East & West: <strong>Aizanalan, Dadel, Baxothanal, Nabanelaz</strong>.</li>

<li>Before you commit the final deed, focus thy mind upon the word of power: Aselothal.</li>
<li>As you enter a properly Magickal state, at last slay the goat with thy iron sword. Now use the blood to draw the sigil of Horyazmor on the ground before you.</li>

He can giveth correct honour and dignity to any. Under the influence of Celestial bodies, you may find him easier to contact when Saturn is in Ascendency. Necessary for the summoning or evocation of Hezazal the Seigneur shall be a lifeless mouse, which shall please Hezazal greatly. <p>His sigil looks like this:</p>
<div class="w3-row-padding">
<div class="w3-quarter w3-container"> <p></p> </div><div class="w3-half w3-container"><img src="sigils/sigil__78.png"class="w3-image"></div>
</div>
</p>
<p><p>Before the ritual can begin you must meditate for a day & find a Cat and pull its Tail and get the Lifeless mouse.</p>
<p>His conjuration relies upon the correct figures, and this is how they are Chalked.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, clean and sweep a Roome, as high as possible in the house and as far away from other people.</li>
<li>With the room prepared, take a black chalk or Pencile and enscribe a circle of 9 feet upon the floor. You must do this with your righte hand, or you will wet yourself. Finally Chalke his seale throughout the diameter of the circle.</li>
<li>Next, take the lifeless mouse which you have prepared & place it carefully at the Centre point, taking utmost care as you do so.</li>
<li>All this done, around the perimeter of the Circle, write the following words respectively at the points North, South, East & West: <strong>Hezmorazoth, Charsaz, Charjaz, Arzoth</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now at this Climax of the ritual, to invoke the Seigneur Hezazal intone the following:</p>
