<p><em>Approaching the Arcane Art of Commanding Spiritual Formes of All Sortes
</em></p><hr>
<p>This book will show you the right and appropriate means of conjuring spirits Lovely and silly, although it must be said that most of them indeed are silly and great care must be taken in contacting and summoning them. Indeed, before you would do such a thing, it is important that you read and mark well the true instructions in this booke, for only in following them to the Letter shall you avoid the wrong and the risk of being destroyed utterly by forces beyond your comprehension..</p>

<h3>Of this realm's King</h3>
<p>The lorde of this realm, Athalal, is an Emperor whose name fills men and beasts alike with fear, and the sound of this name, pronounced properly, is akin to a dire scream. Should you incur his ire, your most beloved friend shall be turned into an ibex, which you shall be made to watch, and then you shall both die. If and only if it pleases him, he may appear as a Reptile or a Turtle. Whichever it may be, he remains a mortal risk to you.</p>

<p><strong>The 13th demon in the Lower realm is called Charqazeloth.</strong> He is a Viscount in this realm. There are 4 spirits in attendance of him, who may do your bidding. His voice soundeth melodious when you call on him. He disguises himself as a horse and in the spirit realm as a centaure. He may also come to you as a miserable clerk to drive a bargain.  He can come to discover things hidden or lost. Under the influence of Celestial bodies, you may find him easier to contact when Uranus is in Ascendency.
