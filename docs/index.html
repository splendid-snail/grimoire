<p><em>Detailing the Occult Method for Evoking Beings of All Sortes
</em></p><hr>
<p>This book will show you the appropriate and right means of conjuring spirits true and ugly, although it must be said that most of them indeed are ugly and great care must be taken in contacting and summoning them. Indeed, before you would do such a thing, it is important that you read and mark well the Good instructions in this booke, for only in following them to the Letter shall you avoid the incorrect and the risk of being destroyed utterly by forces beyond your comprehension..</p>
<hr><h2>On the Structure of the Demonic realms</h2><p>Know that the Empire of the demonic forms is divided into SIX Kingdoms, four of those being aligned with the Cardinal points of the Compasse, and the other two with the Upper and lower Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Each of these six Realmes is governed by a fearsome King.</p>
<ol>
<li> The North realm, governed by King Bowan</li>
<li> The East realm, governed by Emperor Mopazothel</li>
<li> The South realm, governed by Basileus Heqanothan</li>
<li> The West realm, governed by King Darymorel</li>
<li> The Upper realm, governed by King Aipan</li>
<li> The Lower realm, governed by Emperor Borrothothan</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these Kings is attended by a personal Host of 13 Demons or Spirits, varying in power and ability, all of whom this book will show you how to successfully Conjure. The spirits serving these kings are arrayed thus:</p>

<hr><h2>The King and Spirits of the North realm</h2>
<p>This kingdom is dominated by the mightye King Bowan. In this realm`s Pleroma are the spirits of snowe and cold things, where the influences of earth are most strong.</p>
<h3>Of this realm's King</h3>
<p>The lorde of this realm, Bowan, is a King whose name makes men and beast alike quake with fear. If you anger him, you shall never again find joy in your life, which will be much shortened, and shall end with your complete dissolution. While the formes can not be evoked directly, at his Will he may go about as a cate or a mule. Whichever it may be, he remains a mortal risk to you.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Gukothothel">Of this realm's 1st Demon, Gukothothel</h3>
<p><strong>The 1st demon in the North realm is called Gukothothel.</strong> He is a Marquiz in the army of Bowan. The Marquiz Gukothothel commands a moderate force of 29 spirits who he may show you. His voice is strange and wheedling. When in disguise he goes about as a mouse and in the spirit realm as a kobold. To walk among men he appeareth as a soulful chef.  He can restoreth lost dignity and honours. Under the influence of Celestial bodies, you may find him easier to contact when Saturn is in Ascendency. Necessary for the summoning or evocation of Gukothothel the Marquiz shall be a candle, which shall please Gukothothel greatly. <p>This is his seal:</p>

<p>Go through the following physical motions to conjure this Marquiz Gukothothel.</p>
<ol><li>The first step is to attract the demon's attention. To do so, thou must focus thy mental effort upon Thy right arm. Make sure also that you have the candle close at hand.</li>
<li>When this is done, the next thing is to Push out Thy Left foot while you  gesture with Thy finger of Thy left hand.</li>
<li>Continue this last thing until your brow is beaded with sweat, and then lastly gyrate your Fists in climax, while you chant "Hazmmormor, Hazmmormor", and all the while hold the candle close about you.</li>
<li>As you feel the dark Power rise within you, use the candle to trace the seale of Gukothothel in the Aire, chanting "Hazmmormor" as you do.</li>
</ol>

<li>Next, in this place you must prepare altar of bone and place the mirror upon it. You may feel fear while you do so, but to appease Daganothaz you must do it whilst seeming to show good cheer.</li>
<li>At last, setting the bound and restrained deer upon thy altar, take a candlestick holder in thy hand.</li>
<li>Before you commit the final deed, focus thy mind upon the word of power: Darsel.</li>
<li>And the last Acte in pleasing the great Daganothaz is to kill the deer with thy candlestick holder and use the blood to draw the sigil of Daganothaz on the ground before you.</li>
