<p><em>Detailing the Occult Art of Commanding Daemons Completely
</em></p><hr>
<p>This book will show you the truthful and Right means of conjuring spirits fair and silly, although it must be said that most of them indeed are silly and great care must be taken in contacting and summoning them. Indeed, before you would do such a thing, it is important that you read and mark well the witty instructions in this booke, for only in following them to the Letter shall you avoid the false and the risk of utter dissolution by Demonic forces.</p>
<hr><h2>On the Structure of the Demonic realms</h2><p>Know that the Empire of the demonic forms is divided into SIX Kingdoms, four of those being aligned with the Cardinal points of the Compasse, and the other two with the Upper and lower Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Each of these six Realmes is governed by a powerful King.</p>
<ol>
<li> The North realm, governed by Lord Bafel</li>
<li> The East realm, governed by Lord Helan</li>
<li> The South realm, governed by Lord Belelmor</li>
<li> The West realm, governed by King Adodal</li>
<li> The Upper realm, governed by Emperor Hortel</li>
<li> The Lower realm, governed by King Dalfofofo</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these Kings is attended by a personal Host of 13 Demons or Spirits, varying in power and ability, all of whom this book will show you how to successfully Conjure. The spirits serving these kings are arrayed thus:</p>

<hr><h2>The King and Spirits of the North realm</h2>
<p>The cruel Lord Bafel dominateth this realm. Among the strongest influences here are Cold things and snow, which is the domain of Earth.</p>
<h3>Of this realm's King</h3>
<p>The lorde of this realm, Bafel, is a Lord who maketh all who know him quake with fear at the mere sound of his grotesque name. If you anger him, he shall destroy your very soul. Going about unknown in the world of men, he may take the form of a parrot or a Lion, this latter of an unnatural colour.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Aizazmor">Of this realm's 1st Demon, Aizazmor</h3>
<p><strong>The 1st demon in the North realm is called Aizazmor.</strong> He is a mere and lowly Viscount of this realm, barely noticed by his king Bafel and thereby more able to serve you. As a Viscount, Aizazmor commands 2 spirits which may do your bidding. If he speaketh to you, it shall be in a shaky voice. He disguises himself as a gopher and he shows himself to initiates as a wraith. He can bewitch men into seeing him as a leery clerk.  cause the Spirits under him to gather together upon their Sepulchres. His Planetary influence is Neptune. Before attempting to summon the Viscount Aizazmor you will need to find a rough stone and keep it about you. <p>His seale is thus to me made:</p>
<div class="w3-row-padding">
<div class="w3-quarter w3-container"> <p></p> </div><div class="w3-half w3-container"><img src="sigils/sigil__1.png"class="w3-image"></div>
</div>
</p>
<p><p>Before attempting to summon the Viscount Aizazmor, you will need to spend a day thinking on the Demon's name and prepare several candlese. You will also need to prepare the rough stone.</p>
<p>This demon is most taken with signs and sigils, and will require geomantic encouragement before he will shew himself to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, clean and sweep a Roome, as high as possible in the house and as far away from other people.</li>
<li>With the room prepared, take a blue chalk or Pencile and enscribe a circle of 4 feet upon the floor. You must do this with your left hand, or you will be killed by a cheerful maide. Finally Chalke his seale throughout the diameter of the circle.</li>
<li>Next, take the rough stone which you have prepared and place it at the West point of the circle.</li>
<li>All this done, around the perimeter of the Circle, write the following words respectively at the points North, South, East & West: <strong>Dazazmor, Heraz, Hazkaz, Bavalalmor</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now at this Climax of the ritual, to invoke the Viscount Aizazmor intone the following:</p>
<div class = "w3-card w3-white"> <div class="w3-container">

<h3 id="Bolelan">Of this realm's 2nd Demon, Bolelan</h3>
<p><strong>The 2nd demon in the North realm is called Bolelan.</strong> He is a lesser Viscount. As a humble Viscount in the forces of his Lord Bafel, Bolelan commands a smalle company of 3 spirits. You shall hear him speak in a frightening voice. He has shewn himself as a Wolf, and his demonic form is like to that of a flaming fire. He may also come forth in human forme as a critical servant.  His office is to giveth answers to All things, past, present and to come. Though an infernal spirit Bolelan is subject to Heavenly influences and the Planet Uranus inflences his actions. Necessary for the summoning or evocation of Bolelan the Viscount shall be a pie dish, which shall please Bolelan greatly. <p>His sigil looks like this:</p>
<div class="w3-row-padding">
<div class="w3-quarter w3-container"> <p></p> </div><div class="w3-half w3-container"><img src="sigils/sigil__2.png"class="w3-image"></div>
</div>
</p>
<p><p>Before attempting to summon the Viscount Bolelan, you will need to spit at a church and light fragrant incense. You will also need to prepare the pie dish.</p>
<p>Bolelan is a being of Chaos, and will be most pleased with you if you shew a Dance for him.</p>
<ol><li>The first step is to gesture withe Your heade, which shall attract the Demon's attention. Make sure also that you have the pie dish close at hand.</li>
<li>When this is done, the next thing is to swirl your right fist while you  push out your left hand.</li>
<li>Keep doing this until you reach a frenzy, keeping the pie dish held close about you at all times, & finally wave youre finger of youre right hand while you chant "Mowalmoroth, Mowalmoroth".</li>
<li>As you feel the dark Power rise within you, use the pie dish to trace the seale of Bolelan in the Aire, chanting "Mowalmoroth" as you do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now at this Climax of the ritual, to invoke the Viscount Bolelan intone the following:</p>
<div class = "w3-card w3-white"> <div class="w3-container">

<h3 id="Salmorel">Of this realm's 3rd Demon, Salmorel</h3>
<p><strong>The 3rd demon in the North realm is called Salmorel.</strong> He is a Baronet of this realm, humbly serving his king Bafel. There are 3 spirits in attendance of him, who may do your bidding. If he speaketh to you, it is in a wheedling voice. You may see him firste as an antelope and in the spirit realm as a sphinx. To go among men he also appeareth as a sulky chef.  When beguiled, he can causeth great Battles and conflicts. Though an infernal spirit Salmorel is subject to Heavenly influences and the Planet Mars inflences his actions. In order to conjure and evoke the Baronet Salmorel, you must make sure you have with you a lyre, for it shall be required in the summoning. <p>His seale appeareth thus:</p>

<h3 id="Hazdal">Of this realm's 13th Demon, Hazdal</h3>
<p><strong>The 13th demon in the Lower realm is called Hazdal.</strong> He is a great Prince of this realm. Hazdal commands a host of 69 spirits & demons, whom he may place at thy command. If he speaketh to you, it shall be in a shaky voice. He has shewn himself as a jaguare, and in his spirit form he may appear as a manticore. He can bewitch men into seeing him as an Angelic clown.  He may maketh a man invisible. Though an infernal spirit Hazdal is subject to Heavenly influences and the Planet Venus inflences his actions. Before attempting to summon the Prince Hazdal you will need to find a Dead cat and keep it about you. <p>This is his seal:</p>

<div class="w3-quarter w3-container"> <p></p> </div><div class="w3-half w3-container"><img src="sigils/sigil__78.png"class="w3-image"></div>
</div>
</p>
<p><p>Before summoning Prince Hazdal, Spend a day thinking on the demon's name and light fragrant incense and obtain a useful dead cat.</p>
<p>Hazdal is a powerful Prince in King Dalfofofo's army, and demands a sacrificial ritual before he will shew himself.</p>
<ol>
<li>First get a fine Cow, the best you can find.</li>
<li>You will suffer the most dire consequences if this ritual is not performed in a dark room.</li>
<li>In this place, you must now prepare bone altar, & do so solemnly. When you are done, place the dead cat upon the altar.</li>
<li>Next place the well-bound Cow upon the altar and taketh a Stone.</li>
<li>As you steel thyself for the deed, first imagine, then begin to chant aloud the magic word "Hayaz, Hayaz".</li>
<li>As you enter a properly Magickal state, at last slay the Cow with thy Stone. Now use the blood to draw the sigil of Hazdal on the ground before you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now at this Climax of the ritual, to invoke the Prince Hazdal intone the following:</p>
