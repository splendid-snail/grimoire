# Grimoire
*Procedural occultism*

Grimoire is a manual for conjuring procedurally generated demons. It's also my [NaNoGenMo 2019])(https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2019) entry.

It's written in Python and outputs a page of HTML.

It uses some content from [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora), and [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) for its output.

It takes inspiration, and recycles some text, from the Lesser Key of Solomon. I'm using Joseph H Peterson's extremely well researched 2001 edition.

Don't mess with this stuff unless you know what you're doing.
