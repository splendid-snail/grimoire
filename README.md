*Procedural occultism: NaNoGenMo 2019 entry*

Grimoire is a manual for conjuring procedurally generated demons.

It's written in Python and outputs a page of HTML. 

It uses some content from [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora), and [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) for its output.

It takes inspiration, and recycles some text, from the Lesser Key of Solomon. I'm using Joseph H Peterson's extremely well researched 2001 edition. 

on't mess with this stuff unless you know what you're doing.
