# Grimoire
*Procedural occultism*

**Now with Ã¶utput! [Read with extreme caution the latest version](https://splendid-snail.github.io/grimoire/).**

Grimoire is a manual for conjuring procedurally generated demons. It's also my [NaNoGenMo 2019])(https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2019) entry.

It's written in Python and outputs a page of HTML. Apologies for the awful and inaccessible design.

It uses some content from [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) for image creation and manipulation.

It takes inspiration, and recycles some text, from the [Lesser Key of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Key_of_Solomon). I'm using Joseph H Peterson's extremely well researched 2001 edition.

It's now mostly complete but I will be making a few tweaks both before and after the NaNoGenMo deadline.

Don't mess with this stuff unless you know what you're doing.
