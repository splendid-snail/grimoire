<hr><h2>The King and Spirits of the North realm</h2>
<p>This realm is maintain`d by the cruel King Gerdmorel. This is the traditional home of Earth and snow, where cold things shall be found.</p>
<h3>Of this realm's King</h3>
<p>The lorde of this realm, Gerdmorel, is a King of seeming good cheer, but mistake him not, he is a fearesome being. If you anger him, your most beloved friend shall be turned into a camel, which you shall be made to watch, and then you shall both die. When he is willing, he has been known to appear in the form of a raccoone or a snake. But it matters not, for you shall not see him.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Gumaz">Of this realm's 1st Demon, Gumaz</h3>
<p><strong>The 1st demon in the North realm is called Gumaz.</strong> He is a lesser Viscount in this realm. There are 3 spirits in attendance of him, who may do your bidding. His voice is strange and reedy. When in disguise he goes about as a sloth, and his demonic form is like to that of an Impe. To go among men he appeareth as an eager jester.

Before attempting to summon the Viscount Gumaz you will need to find a bugle and keep it about you. <p>His sigil looks like this:</p>

</div>
</p>
<p><p>Before attempting to summon the Viscount Gumaz, you will need to meditate for a day and bathe thyself thoroughly. You will also need to prepare the bugle.</p>
<p>This demon is most taken with signs and sigils, and will require geomantic encouragement before he will shew himself to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will need a warm and closed room, without windows of any kind, to perform his Rite.</li>
<li>Next is to take a White chalk and draw a circle of 10 feet upon the floor. You must do this with your left hand, or you will be set upon by a mob. Finally Chalke his seale throughout the diameter of the circle.</li>
<li>Next, take the bugle which you have prepared and place it carefully at the easte point, taking utmost care as you do so.</li>
<li>All this done, around the perimeter of the Circle, write the following words respectively at the points North, South, East and West: <strong>Buban, Behelothmor, Saselalmor, Borlelanoth</strong>.</li>
